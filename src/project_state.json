  "summary": "Replace the existing WaveCraft Pro build plan with a Vizzy-style, fully functional browser-based music visualizer SaaS spec: audio upload + analysis, multiple visualizer types, rich customization panel, multi-aspect canvas system, export system, optional user accounts/projects, and mobile-first dark modern UI with strong Android performance requirements. (Backend/export tech stack choice remains unresolved vs prior IC/Motoko + ffmpeg.wasm constraints.)",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Treat any UI sections/options marked “Coming Soon” (per user screenshots) as required for full implementation now; remove “Coming Soon” placeholders and wire them to real functionality (background controls, text/branding controls, and any other options shown).",
    "Add a new left-sidebar section for Creations/Templates: gallery view includes built-in templates + user-generated projects; define a publish/share flag to control inclusion in the public/creations gallery.",
    "Add a right-side Controls tab/panel for a Presets & Particles Library with instant tap-to-apply behavior; include preset categories covering visualizers, backgrounds, effects, fonts, and particle packs.",
    "Presets expansion: add a large/unlimited batch of high-complexity built-in presets spanning all categories (visualizer/background/text-font/particles/effects) with mixed styles, and ship them embedded in-app (no external browsing dependency).",
    "Particle overlay must be fully transparent (no background panel/blur/backdrop); render only particle dots on top of the background image and visualizer so uploaded background images remain visible.",
    "Project scope change: previous WaveCraft Pro plan is replaced by the Vizzy-style master spec; reconcile backend/export/storage architecture later (Vizzy prompt requests Node/Express + DB + server-side FFmpeg, which may conflict with existing IC/Motoko + ffmpeg.wasm approach)."

  "known_issues": [
    "Mobile layout issue: preview area overlaps Audio Upload/Audio Editing panels on small screens, making controls hard to use.",
    "Bug/UX: background particles layer is currently obscuring uploaded background images; particles should render with a transparent backdrop so only dots are visible."
